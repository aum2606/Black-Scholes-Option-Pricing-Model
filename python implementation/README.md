# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (Python)

This project implements the Black-Scholes model for pricing European call and put options in Python. It uses NumPy and SciPy for efficient numerical operations, particularly for vectorized pricing of multiple options simultaneously.

## Features

- Black-Scholes formula for European call and put options
- Calculation of option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
- Implied volatility calculation using Newton-Raphson method
- Vectorized pricing for batch processing using NumPy
- Option chain generation
- Visualization of option prices and Greeks

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
